        Go
        Stapled shut, inside an outside world and I'm
        Sealed in tight, bizarre but right at home
        Claustrophobic, closing in and I'm
        Catastrophic, not again
        I'm smeared across the page and doused in gasoline
        I wear you like a stain, yet I'm the one who's obscene
        Catch me up on all your sordid little insurrections
        I've got no time to lose, I'm just caught up in all the cattle
        Fray the strings, throw the shapes
        Hold your breath, listen
        I am a world before I am a man
        I was a creature before I could stand
        I will remember before I forget
        Before I forget that
        I am a world before I am a man
        I was a creature before I could stand
        I will remember before I forget
        Before I forget that
        I'm ripped across the ditch and settled in the dirt and I'm
        I wear you like a stitch, yet I'm the one who's hurt
        Pay attention to your twisted little indiscretions
        I've got no right to win, I'm just caught up all the battles
        Locked in clutch, pushed in place
        Hold your breath, listen
        I am a world before I am a man
        I was a creature before I could stand
        I will remember before I forget
        Before I forget that
        I am a world before I am a man
        I was a creature before I could stand
        I will remember before I forget
        Before I forget that
        My end, it justifies my means
        All I ever do is delay
        My every attempt to evade
        The end of the road
        And my end, it justifies my means
        All I ever do is delay
        My every attempt to evade
        The end of the road
        I am a world before I am a man
        I was a creature before I could stand
        I will remember before I forget
        Before I forget that
        I am a world before I am a man
        I was a creature before I could stand
        I will remember before I forget
        Before I forget that
        I am a world before I am a man
        I was a creature before I could stand
        I will remember before I forget
        Before I forget that
        Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
        Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
